# Qwen3-TTS Streaming (Axl Fork)

> **This is a private fork for [Axl](https://github.com/rblaurent/axl).** Do not use this directly — use the upstream repo [rekuenkdr/Qwen3-TTS-streaming](https://github.com/rekuenkdr/Qwen3-TTS-streaming) instead.

Fork of [rekuenkdr/Qwen3-TTS-streaming](https://github.com/rekuenkdr/Qwen3-TTS-streaming), which itself builds on [Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS).

## What this fork adds

- `stream_generate_custom_voice()` — streaming support for the `CustomVoice` model type (the upstream fork only supports `voice_clone`)

Everything else comes from upstream. See the [upstream README](https://github.com/rekuenkdr/Qwen3-TTS-streaming) for full documentation.
